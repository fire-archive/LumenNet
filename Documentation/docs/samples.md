| The autopatcher samples demonstrates the user of the autopatcher system. |
| To run it, start one instance one of the AutoPatcherClient sample, and   |
| one of the AutoPatcherServer. The server uses the provided               |
| PostgreRepository class to store the application files in a a PostgreSQL |
| database.\                                                               |
| The client sample (AutopatcherClient) doesn't know anything about the    |
| mechanism used by the server to store the applications. It justs asks    |
| for patchs for applications.\                                            |
| \                                                                        |
| **BitPacketTest**\                                                       |
| *Beginner*\                                                              |
| This sample tests the packet splitting capabilities of RakNet. All it    |
| does is send a large block of data to the feedback loop.\                |
| \                                                                        |
| **BitStream**\                                                           |
| *Beginner*\                                                              |
| The bitstream sample doesn't have much functionality but is instead      |
| intended to provide a clear sample of how to write and read bitstreams.  |
| It is all contained in one program and uses RPC to transmit the data. It |
| writes a string and some numbers and shows how to read branching data.\  |
| \                                                                        |

| Chat Example Server**\                                                   |
| *Beginner*\                                                              |
| A simple chat server and a simple chat client. Unlike a real game, it    |
| encodes strings directly into the data stream and reads them out         |
| directly. Normally you would use a packet ID. It use static data to      |
| transmit the name and message of the day. To test, run an instance of    |
| the server and two or more instances of the client.\                     |
| \                                                                        |

| This sample will read all the files in the Debug directory, generate a   |
| 20 byte SHA-1 code for them, and send that over the network. If the code |
| generated by the client and server match then the files are good. This   |
| shows a simple way to test the integrity of files on the client -        |
| although you will have to take other steps to prevent them from being    |
| modified in memory or changed after this test.\                          |
| \                                                                        |

| *CommandConsoleClient demonstrates connecting to the command console,    |
| using the RakNet transport protocol. It's the equivalent of a secure     |
| telnet client.\                                                          |
| CommandConsoleServer demonstrates the command console server, which can  |
| be which can be a standalone application or part of your game server. It |
| allows you to easily parse text strings sent from a client using either  |
| secure RakNet or Telnet.\                                                |
| \                                                                        |
| **Compression**\                                                         |
| *Intermediate*\                                                          |
| This sample shows how to use the global compression scheme in RakNet.    |
| You have to start two or more instances of the program, passing nothing  |
| when queried for the frequency tables. Then chat for a while to 'train'  |
| the data. After quitting you will be prompted to save the frequency      |
| tables. The server should then send its frequency table to the clients,  |
| and one of the clients send its frequency table to the server. For       |
| better accuracy you can sum up the frequencies from all the clients and  |
| send that. Then start the program over again and enter the files you     |
| just generated when prompted. If everything works, you can chat again.   |
| When you quit you will be given statistics on how much bandwidth you     |
| saved by sending compressed data.\                                       |
| \                                                                        |
| **ConnectionGraph**\                                                     |
| *Beginner*\                                                              |
| This sample demonstrates the connection graph plugin, which is used to   |
| maintain a list of all connections on the network.\                      |
| \                                                                        |
| **DirectoryDeltaTransferTest**\                                          |
| *Intermediate*\                                                          |
| This sample demonstrates the plugin to incrementally transfer compressed |
| deltas of directories. In essence, it's a simple autopatcher.\           |
| Unlike the full autopatcher, it has no dependencies. It is suitable for  |
| patching from non-dedicated servers at runtime.\                         |
| \                                                                        |
| **Dropped Connection Test**\                                             |

| This test randomly starts and stops connections for n clients, where n   |
| can be changed from a define at the top of the file. Since all clients   |
| are in the same exe on the same computer the n threads created may slow  |
| things down.\                                                            |
| \                                                                        |

| This is a tutorial on how to load, save, and use RSA keys with [secure   |
| connections](secureconnections.html). The process is difficult to        |
| explain in a manual but easy to follow in code. Helpful to have some     |
| familiarity with RSA encryption.\                                        |
| \                                                                        |
| **Flow Control Test**\                                                   |
| *Beginner*\                                                              |
| RakNet automatically handles flow control, which is evident from this    |
| test. This test only really has meaning when run over the internet,      |
| where there is limited bandwidth. You can also try using                 |
| RakPeer::ApplyNetworkSimulator to make things look more real.\           |
| \                                                                        |

| *This project tests and demonstrates the fully connected mesh plugin. No |
| data is actually sent so it's mostly a sample of how to use a plugin.\   |
| *\                                                                       |

| Sends an offline ping to everyone at IP "255.255.255.255". All active    |
| servers on a LAN should respond with a pong.\                            |
| \                                                                        |

| The loopback performance test is good for discovering implementation     |
| flaws and measuring implementation efficiency. It is fairly complex with |
| a large number of parameters but has defaults for everything - just hit  |
| enter. You will need to start 3 instances of the program and enter 1,    |
| then 2, then 3 when prompted. You can hit enter for all other parameters |
| if you wish. Detailed statistics are shown during runtime and at the end |
| of the test.\                                                            |

| code.\                                                                   |

| Shows how to use the ReplicaManager class in a Client/Server environment |
| or P2P. ReplicaManager is a very lightweight and efficient system that   |
| provides object creation, destruction, and serialization updates such    |
| that you have all copies of all desired objects on all desired systems   |
| semi-automatically.\                                                     |
| See [ReplicaManager](replicamanager.html) for more details.\             |

| Demonstration of the Router plugin. The Router plugin exposes a Send     |
| function allowing you to send to systems you are not directly connected  |
| to.\                                                                     |
| \                                                                        |

| A client connects to a server and static data is shared between them.    |
| This sample covers all functionality associated with this and shows the  |
| more complex cases where you want to update data on the other system or  |
| only change data locally.\                                               |
| \                                                                        |
| **Timestamping**\                                                        |
| *Beginner*\                                                              |
| In this sample, a sender writes the timestamp identifier and a timestamp |
| into a byte stream and sends it to a recipient. It demonstrates how      |
| RakNet will automatically modify the timestamp so that it is system      |
| relative.\                                                               |
