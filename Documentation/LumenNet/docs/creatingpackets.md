| packets</span>\                                                          |
| \                                                                        |
| Systems that run RakNet, and in fact all systems on the internet,        |
| communicate through what is commonly known as packets. Or more           |
| accurately in the case of UDP, datagrams. Each datagram is created by    |
| RakNet and contains one or more messages. Messages could be created by   |
| you, such as position or health, or sometimes are created by RakNet      |
| internally, such as pings. By convention, the first byte of messages     |
| contain a numerical identifier from 0 to 255 which is used to indicate   |
| what type of message it is. RakNet already has a large set of messages   |
| it uses internally, or for plugins. These can be viewed in the file      |
| MessageIdentifiers.h.\                                                   |
| \                                                                        |
| For this example, lets set the position of a timed mine in the           |
| gameworld. We'll need the following data:\                               |
| -   The position of the mine, which is 3 floats. float x, float y,       |
|     float z. You may have your own vector type which you can use intead. |
| -   Some way to refer to the mine that all systems agree on. The         |
|     [NetworkIDObject](networkidobject.html) class is perfect for that.   |
|     Lets assume class Mine inherits from NetworkIDObject. Then all we    |
|     have to store is get the NetworkID of the mine (for more information |
|     see [Receiving Packets](receivingpackets.html), [Sending             |
|     Packets](sendingpackets.html).                                       |
| -   Who owns the mine. That way if someone steps on it we know who to    |
|     give credit to. The built in reference to players, SystemAddress,    |
|     is perfect.. You can use GetExternalID() to get the SystemAddress.   |
| -   When the mine was placed. Lets say after 10 seconds the mine is      |
|     automatically disintegrated, so it's important that we get the time  |
|     correct so the mine doesn't disintegrate at different times on       |
|     different computers. Fortunately the RakNet has the built-in ability |
|     to handle this using [Timestamping](timestamping.html).              |
|                                                                          |
| <span class="RakNetBlueHeader">Use a structure or a bitstream?</span>\   |
| \                                                                        |
| Ultimately, anytime you send data you will send a stream of characters.  |
| There are two easy ways to encode your data into this. One is to create  |
| a structure and cast it to a (char\*) the other is to use the built-in   |
| [BitStream](bitstreams.html) class.\                                     |
| \                                                                        |
| The advantage of creating a structure and casting is that it is very     |
| easy to change the structure and to see what data you are actually       |
| sending. Since both the sender and the recipient can share the same      |
| source file defining the structure, you avoid casting mistakes. There is |
| also no risk of getting the data out of order, or using the wrong types. |
| The disadvantage of creating a structure is that you often have to       |
| change and recompile many files to do so. You lose the compression you   |
| can automatically perform with the bitstream class. And RakNet cannot    |
| automatically endian-swap the structure members.\                        |
| \                                                                        |
| The advantage of using a bitstream is that you don't have to change any  |
| external files to use it. Simply create the bitstream, write the data    |
| you want in whatever order you want, and send it. You can use the        |
| 'compressed' version of the read and write methods to write using fewer  |
| bits and it will write bools using only one bit. You can write data out  |
| dynamically, writing certain values if certain conditions are true or    |
| false. BitStream will automatically endian-swap members written with     |
| Serialize(), Write(), or Read(). The disadvantage of a bitstream is you  |
| are now susceptible to make mistakes. You can read data in a way that    |
| does not complement how you wrote it - the wrong order, a wrong data     |
| type, or other mistakes.\                                                |
| \                                                                        |
| We will cover both ways of creating packets here.\                       |

| As Iâ€™ve probably mentioned earlier, RakNet uses a convention on how      |
| packets (Packet) types are identified. The first byte of the data field  |
| is a single byte enumeration that specifies type, followed by the        |
| transmitted data. In packets that include a time stamp, the first byte   |
| contains ID\_TIMESTAMP, the following 4 bytes the actual time stamp      |
| value, then the byte that identifies the packet, and only then the       |
| actual data transmitted.\                                                |

| Noticed the \#pragma pack(push,1) and \#pragma pack(pop) ? These force   |
| your compiler (in this case VC++), to pack the structure as              |
| byte-aligned. Check your compiler documentation to learn more.           |
|                                                                          |

| Note that when sending structures, RakNet assumes the timeStamp is in    |
| network order. You would have to use the function                        |
| BitStream::EndianSwapBytes() on the timeStamp field to make this happen. |
| To then read the timestamp on the receiving system, use if               |
| (bitStream-&gt;DoEndianSwap()) bitStream-&gt;ReverseBytes(timeStamp,     |
| sizeof(timeStamp). This step is not necessary if using BitStreams.       |
|                                                                          |
| Fill out your packet. For our timed mine, we want the form that uses     |
| timestamping. So the end result should look like the following...        |
|                                                                          |

| As I wrote in the comment above, we have to define enums for our own     |
| packets types, so when the data stream arrives in a Receive call we know |
| what we are looking at. You should define your enums as starting at      |
| ID\_USER\_PACKET\_ENUM, like this:                                       |
|                                                                          |

| enum {\                                                                  |
| ID\_SET\_TIMED\_MINE = ID\_USER\_PACKET\_ENUM,\                          |
| // More enums....\                                                       |
| };\                                                                      |
| </span>\                                                                 |
| NOTE THAT YOU CANNOT INCLUDE POINTERS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN THE      |
| STRUCTS.\                                                                |

| It seems to be a fairly common mistake that people include a pointer or  |
| a class with a pointer in the struct and think that the data pointed to  |
| by the pointer will be sent over the network. This is not the case - all |
| it would send is the pointer address\                                    |
| \                                                                        |
| Nested Structures\                                                       |

| There is no problem with nesting structures. Just keep in mind that the  |
| first byte is always what determines the packet type.\                   |

| It is possible to write strings using the array overload of the          |
| BitStream. One way to do it would be to write the length, then the data  |
| such as:                                                                 |

| <span class="RakNetCode">void WriteStringToBitStream(char \*myString,    |

| Decoding is similar. However, that is not very efficient. RakNet comes   |
| with a built in StringCompressor called... stringCompressor. It is a     |
| global instance. With it, WriteStringToBitStream becomes:                |
|                                                                          |
| <span class="RakNetCode">void WriteStringToBitStream(char \*myString,    |
| BitStream \*output)\                                                     |

| Not only does it encode the string, so the string can not easily be read |
| by packet sniffers, but it compresses it as well. To decode the string   |
| you would use:                                                           |
|                                                                          |
| <span class="RakNetCode">void WriteBitStreamToString(char \*myString,    |

| The 256 in this case is the maximum number of bytes to write and read.   |
| In EncodeString, if your string is less than 256 it will write the       |
| entire string. If it is greater than 256 characters it will truncate it  |
| such that it would decode to an array with 256 characters, including the |
| null terminator.                                                         |

| RakNet also has a string class, RakNet::RakString, found in RakString.h  |

| 1. You can also write structs directly into a Bitstream simply by        |
| casting it to a (char\*). It will copy your structs using memcpy. As     |
| with structs, it will not dereference pointers so you should not write   |
| pointers into the bitstream.\                                            |
| 2. If you use a string very commonly, you can use the StringTable class  |
| instead. It works the same way as StringCompressor, but can send two     |
| bytes to represent a known string.\                                      |
