| <span class="RakNetBlueHeader">More sophisticated networking when using  |
| Unity</span>\                                                            |
|                                                                          |
| [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) uses RakNet version                         |
| [3.731](http://www.raknet.net/raknet/downloads/RakNet-3.731.zip), which  |
| should also be network compatible with                                   |
| [3.732](http://www.raknet.net/raknet/downloads/RakNet-3.732.zip). In     |
| order to use RakNet with Unity, you do not have to download RakNet or    |
| sign a license agreement, as Unity ships RakNet integrated into the      |
| binary code already.                                                     |
|                                                                          |
| If you want more sophisticated networking, such as being able to run     |
| your own server, more efficient network communication for an MMO, or to  |
| otherwise modify or extend the networking of Unity you can use RakNet    |
| version 4.x, which has [C\# support](swigtutorial.html). Unity allows    |
| you to write game code in C\#, therefore you would be able to use write  |
| your own network code using RakNet directly and have full access to its  |
| feature set.                                                             |
|                                                                          |
| Unity users do not have access RakNet 4.x. So it is necessary to         |
| [contact us](http://www.raknet.net/contact.html) for a license when      |
| planning to make this upgrade.                                           |
|                                                                          |
