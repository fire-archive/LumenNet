| <span class="RakNetBlueHeader">Limit incoming messages by                |
| category</span>\                                                         |
|                                                                          |
| With client/server topologies, you do not usually want any system to     |
| send any message. For example, perhaps only the server can send kill     |
| messages. Or perhaps you want to segment players into stages, where      |
| players who have logged on but not yet provided their password cannot    |
| yet send game messages. The message filter is designed to deal with      |
| these situations automatically.                                          |
|                                                                          |
| The MessageFilter plugin defines categories of users by 'filterSet'      |
| which is just a numerical identifier supplied by the user. For example,  |
| you may have one filter set for newly connected systems, and another for |
| authenticated systems. For each filter set you can                       |
|                                                                          |
| 1.  Automatically add new connections                                    |
| 2.  Allow RPC calls                                                      |
| 3.  Limit what messages, or ranges of messages, can be received, and     |
|     what actions to take if this condition is violated (kick/ban/notify) |
| 4.  Delete them                                                          |
|                                                                          |
| **Example:**                                                             |
|                                                                          |
| messageFilter.SetAutoAddNewConnectionsToFilter(0);\                      |
| messageFilter.SetAllowMessageID(true, ID\_USER\_PACKET\_ENUM,            |
| ID\_USER\_PACKET\_ENUM, 0);\                                             |
| messageFilter.SetAllowMessageID(true, ID\_USER\_PACKET\_ENUM+1,          |
| ID\_USER\_PACKET\_ENUM+1, 1);                                            |
|                                                                          |
| This setup would automatically add all new connections to filter set 0,  |
| and only allow the message ID\_USER\_PACKET\_ENUM to arrive. It would    |
| also create a new filter set, with the filterSet id 1, that only allowed |
| ID\_USER\_PACKET\_ENUM+1 to arrive.                                      |
|                                                                          |
| **Messages that are always allowed (filtering them has no effect):**     |
|                                                                          |
